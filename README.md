## âœ¨Data Structure and Algorithm Comprehensive Assignment

Definition: 

   ðŸŒŸ In a school, students of 5th Grade are going for a picnic. For a particular game between 10 players, they need to be organized in the ascending order of their height. Teacher selects a one random student out of 10. That student acts as a mediator, all students having height less than mediator goes on left and rest on his right. The same process repeats again between the left and right group. The process continues and will stop when all the players are in ascending order of their height. Signify which sorting algorithm can be helpful to design this model and how? What additional functionality can you add to this. Implement the given model.
